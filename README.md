# Linear-Regression-Assignment
Repository containing submissions files for Linear Regression Assignment for Bike Sharing Problem

## Objective
This case study is focussed on a US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes which makes bikes available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. The company has suffered recent losses due to covid-19 and aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

#### Goal
Create a suitable model the demand for shared bikes with the available dataset (data.csv). It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
